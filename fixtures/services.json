Early planning for closure enables the Company to address specific Project issues and uncertainties in the designs which can be updated over the life cycle of the Project. With limited information at the feasibility study stage regarding Closure, a conceptual plan is usually prepared and is required in Tanzania as part of the Environmental Impact Statement that needs Government approval prior to issuance of the Mining Licence. The Conceptual Closure Plan needs to be updated regularly as more operational data, information and studies become available. Savijo Geo-Engineering Company assists its Clients in preparation of conceptual closure plans and updating them to Detailed Closure Plans.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; min-height: 14.0px;\"><br></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 18.7px Times; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-kerning: none;\"><strong>Permits minerals rights and Management services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-kerning: none;\">Savijo Geo-Engineering Company carries out the required processes to prepare and submit mining and prospecting right applications, this includes all the necessary permits and related authorizations.<br>We provide services of preparing a Legal Register/permitting plan based on a legislative review and in relation to a particular project, from the initial stages of the project, execution and closure.

Small scale operations usually have limited funding, and ability to optimize the use of fund is critical in these operations. With the increasing overheads and commitments associated with employing full-time staff, outsourcing of Exploration and Mining Personnel makes good economic and legal sense.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",
